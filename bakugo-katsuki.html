		<p>Bakugo Katsuki is the childhood friend of Deku. He’s a self-assured individual with impressive intellect, physical strength, combat instincts, unwavering conviction and a very short fuse. He strives to be the best and always aims for “Total Victory”. His Quirk「爆破」(lit. Explosion) makes the sweat glands in his palms secrete a nitroglycerin-like substance, allowing him to create explosions of various sizes at will.</p>

			<li>HOWITZER IMPACT</li><dd>This move is the strongest move in Katsuki's arsenal, which involves Katsuki taking to the air, and then using explosions to propel himself in a circular motion to create a tornado. This tornado builds up oxygen to fuel the incoming explosion. After colliding with the target, Katsuki releases the powerful aforementioned explosion.</dd>

			<li>AP SHOT</li><dd>Katsuki stretches out one of his hands and uses his other hand to form a circle on the palm of his outstretched hand. Katsuki then fires an explosion through the circle, which creates a concentrated blast beam. By focusing the path of his explosions into a single point instead of around his whole palm, Katsuki creates a concentrated blast with reduced area of impact, but with enough power to successfully pierce solid concrete.</dd>

			<li>STUN GRENADE</li><dd>Katsuki starts by creating a sphere of light between his hands that explodes into a large scale flash. Similar to the effect of an actual stun grenade, the flash of light blinds anyone close by.</dd>
