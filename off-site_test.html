			<li>HOWITZER IMPACT</li><dd>This move is one of his strongest & most devastating Super Moves to date. It’s primarily used as a sure-fire way to finish off opponents & for showing off. The move involves Bakugo using his Quirk to propel himself up and rapidly spin in the air. This circular motion results in a tornado that builds up oxygen for his incoming assault. Once he has enough fuel and finally reaches his target, Bakugo unleashes the torrent of explosions upon the point of impact.</dd>

			<li>AP SHOT</li><dd>This move is known for its versatility & it’s his go-to Super Move. It’s primarily used for long range assaults & can be adjusted accordingly for its accuracy or potency depending on the situation. The move involves Bakugo putting his hands together, using one hand to form a circle on the palm of his other. Bakugo then detonates his Quirk through that single opening, allowing him to fire concentrated blasts that are strong enough to pierce solid concrete.</dd>

			<li>STUN GRENADE</li><dd>This move is the flashiest (pun intended) out of all his Super Moves. However, it deals the least amount of damage to his opponent, blindness notwithstanding. Because of this, the move is primarily used for creating distractions & disorienting opponents rather than actual offensive maneuvers. The move involves Bakugo deploying his Quirk to create a sphere of light between his hands. That flash of light acts very similarly to an actual stun grenade when used in the vicinity of other people, hence its namesake.</dd>
